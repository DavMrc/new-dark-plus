# Welcome to New Dark Plus

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your color theme extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the location of the theme file and specifies the base theme of the theme.
* `themes/New Dark Plus-color-theme.json` - the color theme definition file.
* `themes/dark_vs.json` - my Python-specific (but not exclusive) version of Dark Plus

To start using this extension with Visual Studio Code, copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
